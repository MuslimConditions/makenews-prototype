India has not attacked anyone. Nor is it hungry for any territory. But in the two World Wars (in which India had no direct stake), 1.5 lakh Indian soldiers had laid down their lives fighting for others, Modi said at a function to inaugurate a centre for overseas Indians.",

Mr. Rohatgi contended that Article 262 mandated that the Supreme Court cannot entertain any matter pertaining to an inter-State river dispute once a tribunal set up under parliamentary legislation - in this case the 1956 Act - has passed its final order In this case, this would mean that the Supreme Court should not have entertained any petitions or applications post the 2007 Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal final order.

A stronger monsoon could also result in a real GDP growth of 7.9 per cent this fiscal and agriculture GDP at an above-trend 4 per cent, according to the ratings agency. CRISIL expects nominal agricultural GDP to rise by Rs.1.49 trillion this fiscal, compared with Rs.978 billion in 2015-16. Rural markets, which account for 54 per cent of private consumption, are already seeing some green shoots, according to the note “So this time around, India’s consumption story will have two legs instead of just the urban engine on which it has duked out the past two years,” Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist at CRISIL said. “We see private consumption rising 90 basis points to 8.3 per cent this fiscal compared with 7.4 per cent in fiscal 2016. Stress point Overall, despite a slow start in June, the monsoon has been recorded as ‘normal’, at just three per cent lower than the long-term average. This has meant that the area coverage under kharif crops has risen to 1,060 lakh hectares compared with 1,052 lakh hectares last year. There are still some stress points, mainly in Gujarat and Karnataka, where some districts had their second or third consecutive deficient monsoon, but these account for a small part of agricultural output, according to CRISIL.",

They were spotted on three separate occasions over the course of 15 months in 2014 when scientists observed Europa passing in front of Jupiter. The potential plumes were only observed three out of 10 times when Europa passed by Jupiter, suggesting that the eruptions are intermittent, he said.
